To use the program:

Step 1. Open the Windows command prompt (press Windows button + R and enter "cmd" in the text field without the quotes)
Step 2. Once the command prompt is open, enter the following command: cd "path to the project src folder", e.g. cd "C:\Workspace BU\InformationRetrieval-ADD\src"
Step 3. Once in the correct folder, enter the following command: javac MainController.java
Step 4. Enter the following command: java MainController

Now the program should ask you for the folder where the text files are located in.
Step 5. Enter the folder path, eg. C:\temp\test

--> Program outputs the inverted index

Now the program asks you to enter the query terms

Step 6. Enter each word to search for separated by a space, eg. "Michael Jackson" (without the quotes)

--> Program outputs document's in descending order in respect to their ranking

Now the program will ask if you want to enter another query.

NOTE: After entering the command from step 3, the Windows command prompt will give a Note about unchecked or unsafe operations. Please ignore this and continue normally.
